# ML-for-fun
The ML-for-fun repo documents bits and pieces of my learnings in data science and machine learning over my 2019 summer break and beyond. I started
off with learning python in June 2019 with an aim to get into the field and have been fascinated since then. Being a complete 
beginner and self learning the math and programming from youtube, coursera, and research papers has been an enlightening journey
and I hope to continue improving my skill in the years to come! :)

PS: Expecting to come up with a real-time project by November 2019
